## Game Mechanics

1. The game starts by displaying the game logo.
2. The player is presented with the option to choose a difficulty level: 'easy' or 'hard'. The number of turns allowed in the game depends on the chosen difficulty level.
3. A random number between 1 and 100 is generated, which the player needs to guess.

4. The player is prompted to make a guess, and their input is compared against the generated number.
5. If the player's guess is higher than the generated number, the game displays "Too high" and deducts one turn.
6. If the player's guess is lower than the generated number, the game displays "Too low" and deducts one turn.
7. If the player's guess matches the generated number, the game displays "You got it!" along with the correct answer.
8. The game continues until the player runs out of turns or successfully guesses the number.
9. If the player runs out of turns, the game displays "You ran out of turns. You lose!" and ends.
10. After each incorrect guess, the game prompts the player to guess again.
