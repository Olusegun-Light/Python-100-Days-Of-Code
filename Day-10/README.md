# Functions With OutPut

The Functions With Output program demonstrates the concept of functions that return a value in Python.

## Usage

1. Uncomment the following code snippet:

```python
# def format_name():
#     f_name = input("What's your first name? ").capitalize()
#     l_name = input("What's your last name? ").capitalize()
#     print(f_name + " " + l_name)

format_name()
```

2. Run the program in a Python environment.
3. he program will prompt you to enter your first name and last name.
4. After entering your name, the program will print the formatted name by capitalizing the first letter of each name.

Alternatively, you can use the function `format_name(f_name, l_name)` to format a name directly by passing the first name and last name as arguments.

Example:

```python
formated_string = format_name("LiGHt", "OlUsEguN")
print(formated_string)
```

formated_string = format_name("LiGHt", "OlUsEguN")
print(formated_string)

This will output: `Light Olusegun`

Feel free to modify and customize the code to suit your needs.
