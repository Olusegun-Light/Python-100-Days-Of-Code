# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Welcome to the world of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)! This README provides a brief introduction to OOP concepts and demonstrates an example using the `PrettyTable` library.

## Overview

Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects, which represent real-world entities and have properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods). OOP allows for modularity, reusability, and easier maintenance of code.

In this example, we will showcase a simple usage of the `PrettyTable` library, which provides an easy way to create visually appealing tables in Python.

## Methods in OOP

Methods in OOP are functions associated with objects. They define the behaviors or actions that an object of a certain class can perform. Methods can manipulate the object's attributes and interact with other objects.

## Example: PrettyTable Library

In this example, we demonstrate the usage of the `PrettyTable` library to create a table of Pokémon names and their types. The `PrettyTable` library allows us to construct well-formatted and aligned tables in a convenient way.

To run the example, make sure you have the `prettytable` library installed. You can install it using `pip`:

```shell
pip install prettytable
```

Once installed, uncomment the code snippet provided in the Python script, and run the program. You will see a table printed to the console, displaying the Pokémon names and types in a visually appealing format.

Feel free to modify the example code and experiment with different table layouts, data sources, and table formatting options provided by the `PrettyTable` library.

Object-Oriented Programming opens up a wide range of possibilities for organizing and structuring your code. By leveraging the power of objects and methods, you can create more robust and scalable applications. Explore the world of OOP, unleash your creativity, and enjoy the benefits of clean and modular code!

## Happy Coding!

Note: The provided README assumes the usage of the `PrettyTable` library. Please make sure to install the library using `pip` before running the example code.
