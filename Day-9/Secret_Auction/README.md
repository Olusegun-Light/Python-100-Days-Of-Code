## How It Works

1. The program will display a logo at the beginning.

2. Participants will be prompted to enter their name and place their bid.

3. The bids will be stored in a dictionary, where the names of the participants are associated with their respective bid amounts.

4. Participants will be asked if there are any other bidders. If there are, they can enter "yes" to continue with the bidding process. The console will be cleared for anonymity.

5. If there are no other bidders, the program will determine the highest bidder and announce the winner with the highest bid.

## Usage

To use the Secret Auction Game, follow these steps:

1. Run the program in a Python environment.

2. Enter your name when prompted.

3. Place your bid by entering the bid amount.

4. Indicate whether there are any other bidders by typing "yes" or "no".

5. If there are more bidders, repeat steps 2-4. The console will be cleared after each round.

6. Once there are no more bidders, the program will announce the winner with the highest bid.
