# 100 Days of Python Code

![100 Days of Python Code](img/img2.jpg)

Welcome to the 100 Days of Python Code repository! This project is inspired by the "100 Days of Code" challenge and aims to help you strengthen your Python programming skills over the course of 100 days. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this project provides a structured learning path and coding exercises to improve your Python proficiency.

## Overview

The 100 Days of Python Code challenge is divided into 100 daily coding exercises, each focusing on a specific Python concept or programming task. The exercises are designed to be completed within a day and progressively increase in difficulty. By committing to the challenge and consistently coding for 100 days, you can significantly enhance your Python knowledge and become a more confident programmer.

## Getting Started

To get started with the 100 Days of Python Code challenge, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account or download the project files to your local machine.

2. Each day, navigate to the corresponding exercise folder (e.g., Day01, Day02, etc.) to find the exercise prompt and starter code.

3. Read the exercise prompt carefully, which includes a description of the task and any specific requirements.

4. Write your Python code to solve the exercise. Feel free to explore different approaches and experiment with the code.

5. Test your code thoroughly to ensure it behaves as expected and produces the desired output.

6. Document your solution by adding comments, explaining the logic, or providing any necessary explanations.

7. Once you have completed the exercise, commit and push your code to your forked repository or save it locally.

8. Repeat the process for the next exercise on the following day, building upon the concepts and skills learned in previous exercises.

## Project Structure

The project follows a specific structure to organize the exercises and provide a clear progression path. Here's an overview of the project structure:

- **DayXX/**: Each exercise is contained within a separate folder named after the corresponding day (e.g., Day01, Day02, etc.). Inside each folder, you will find the exercise prompt, starter code, and any additional resources or files required for that exercise.

- **README.md**: Each exercise folder includes a README file that provides a detailed description of the exercise, including the task, expected input/output, and any relevant information to complete the exercise successfully.

- **Solutions/**: This folder contains sample solutions to the exercises. It's recommended to solve the exercises on your own before referring to the solutions for comparison or to understand alternative approaches.

Feel free to navigate through the project structure and explore the exercises at your own pace. Remember, the goal is to code consistently for 100 days, but you can adapt the challenge to suit your schedule and learning style.

## Contribution

Contributions to the 100 Days of Python Code project are welcome! If you have any ideas for new exercises, improvements to existing exercises, or general suggestions, please feel free to contribute. You can open an issue to discuss your ideas or submit a pull request with your changes.

## Learning Resources

Throughout the 100 days, you may encounter concepts or topics that require further understanding. Here are some recommended learning resources to supplement your learning journey:

- **Python Documentation**: The official Python documentation is an excellent resource to explore Python's features, libraries, and language syntax. Visit the [Python website](https://www.python.org/doc/) to access the documentation.

- **Online Python Courses**: Online learning platforms such as Coursera, Udemy, and Codecademy offer comprehensive Python courses that cover various topics and skill levels. Consider enrolling in a course to deepen your Python knowledge.

- **Stack Overflow**: When facing challenges or seeking answers to specific programming questions, Stack Overflow
