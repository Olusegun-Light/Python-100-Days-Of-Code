# Randomization in Python

This repository contains Python code examples and explanations related to randomization in Python. It explores the use of the random module, custom modules, and working with lists.

## Randomization

Randomization is a process of generating random numbers or elements in programming. Python utilizes the Mersenne Twister algorithm as its underlying pseudo-random number generator. Here are some examples of randomization in Python:

### Generating Random Numbers

- `random.randint(a, b)`: Returns a random integer between `a` and `b`, inclusive. Raises a `ValueError` if `a > b`.
- `random.random()`: Returns the next random floating-point number between 0.0 and 1.0.

### Custom Modules

A module is a file containing Python code, such as function definitions, statements, or classes. You can create your own module by defining functions or statements in a separate `.py` file and importing it where necessary. In the provided code, the custom module `my_module` is imported, and the value of `pi` from that module is printed.

## Lists

Lists are a fundamental data structure in Python used for organizing and storing data. Here are some examples of working with lists:

- Creating a list: Use square brackets `[ ]` to enclose the items in the list.
- Accessing list items: Use indexing to retrieve items from the list. Indexing starts at 0.
- Modifying list items: Assign a new value to the desired index to modify the item.
- Adding items to a list: Use `.append()` to add a single item to the end of the list. Use `.extend()` to add multiple items to the list.
- Nested lists: Lists can contain other lists as elements, creating nested structures.

## Getting Started

To run the code examples and experiment with randomization and lists in Python, you need a Python environment set up on your machine. You can use an integrated development environment (IDE) or a text editor to write and execute the code. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the code files in your preferred Python editor.
3. Run the code to see the output or modify it to experiment with different scenarios.
4. Feel free to explore and enhance your understanding of randomization and working with lists in Python!
