# Introduction to Python Printing

This README provides an overview of basic printing functionalities in Python and covers concepts such as print statements, string concatenation, input functions, and variables. It also includes an exercise example of a Band Name Generator.

## Printing to the Console in Python

Printing in Python is accomplished using the print() function. The print() function takes a parameter that you want to be printed.

Example:

```
print("Hello World!")
```

In this case, the `print()` function takes in the string `"Hello World!"`, and the output will be `Hello World!` displayed in the console.

- Strings are enclosed within quotes (`""`) to indicate the beginning and end of characters. They can contain any sequence of characters.
- If you encounter an error in the console, copy the entire error message and search for it online to find a possible solution.

## Printing Multiple Statements

To print multiple statements on separate lines, you can use the newline character (\n). It indicates a line break, and any text following it will be printed on a new line.

Example:

```
print("Day 1 - Python Print Function\nThe function is declared like this:\nprint('what to print')")
```

This code snippet combines three separate statements and prints them on separate lines.

## Concatenating Strings

String concatenation involves merging separate strings of characters into one. In Python, you can use the + symbol to concatenate strings.

Example:

```
print("Git" + "Hub")
```

Output:

```
GitHub
```

The two strings `"Git"` and `"Hub"` are concatenated to form the word "GitHub".

## Input Function

The `input()` function is used to gather information from the user. It prompts the user for input and waits for them to enter a value.

Example:

```
input("What is your name?")
```

When this code executes, it will display the prompt "What is your name?", and the user can input their name.

## Variables

Variables are used to store data for later use within the code. In Python, you can assign a value to a variable using the assignment operator (=).

Example:

```
name = input("What is your name?")
```

In this example, the user's name is stored in the variable `name`. The value entered by the user will be assigned to the `name` variable and can be accessed and used later in the code.

## Exercise: Band Name Generator

This exercise demonstrates the usage of the concepts mentioned above. It prompts the user for the city they grew up in and their pet's name, then combines the two to generate a band name.

Example:

```
print("Welcome to the Band Name Generator")

city_name = input("Which city did you grow up in?\n")
pet_name = input("What's your pet's name?\n")

print("Your band name could be " + city_name + " " + pet_name)
```

This code snippet guides the user through inputting their city name and pet's name. The program then generates a band name by combining the city name and pet name.

## Conclusion

This README provides a basic understanding of Python printing, string concatenation, user input, and variables. Feel free to modify and experiment with the code examples to explore different functionalities.
