# Printing to the console in python

1. The print takes in a parameter that you want to be printed

```
print("Hello World!")
```

In this case the 'print' has taken in 'Hello World' and the output/print statement will be Hello World!

- The Hello world! is in a set of parentheses put in quotes "" since they are not codes, text inbetween quotes are called **Strings**. The quotes shows the beginning and end of the characters.

- When you have an error in your console, highlight the whole error google it and luckily you'd find your answer.

2. You can print multiple statement using '\n', it indecated next line and any word after it will be put on a new line
    So instead of 

    ```
    print("Day 1 - Python Print Function")
    print("The function is declared like this:")
    print("print('what to print')")
    ```

    You can easily make it look like this

    ```
    print("Day 1 - Python Print Function\nThe function is declared like this:\nprint('what to print')")
    ```

3. Concatenating Strings: String concatenation is taking seperate string of characters and merging them into one
    To concate strings you can use the '+' symbol
    Example

    ```
    print("Git" + "Hub")

    >GitHub
    ```

4. Input Function: If we want to enter information we can use the input() function
    input("A promot for the user") Example

    ```
    input('What is your name? )
    ```

5. Variables: Used to store data so it can be called back at ant point in the code

    ```
    name = input("what is your name)
    ```
