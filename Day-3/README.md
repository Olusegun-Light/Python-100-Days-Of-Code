# Control Flow and Logical Operators

This repository contains Python code examples and exercises related to control flow and logical operators. These concepts are essential for implementing decision-making logic in programs.

## Code Examples

### Example 1: Bathtub Water Level Control

In this example, we demonstrate how to control the water level in a bathtub to prevent overflowing. The code checks the water level and prints either "Water is running" or "Stop Water" based on the condition.

### Example 2: Ticket Sales for Coaster Ride

This example simulates a ticket store selling tickets for a coaster ride. It incorporates multiple conditions to determine whether a person is eligible to ride and calculates the fare based on age. The code also considers additional factors such as whether the person wants a photo and handles special cases, such as no ticket payment for people with a mid-life crisis.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Odd or Even Number Checker

The first exercise prompts the user to enter a number and checks whether it is odd or even. It uses the modulo operator (%) to determine if the number is divisible by 2 without a remainder.

### Exercise 2: Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator

The second exercise calculates the BMI based on user input for height and weight. It then interprets the BMI value and categorizes the user as underweight, normal weight, slightly overweight, obese, or clinically obese based on predefined ranges.

### Exercise 3: Leap Year Checker

The third exercise checks whether a given year is a leap year. It follows the leap year rules: a year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4 but not divisible by 100, except when it is also divisible by 400.

## Getting Started

To run the code examples or try the exercises, you need a Python environment set up on your machine. You can use an integrated development environment (IDE) or a text editor to write and execute the code. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the code files in your preferred Python editor.
3. Run the code to see the output or modify it to experiment with different scenarios.
4. For exercises, read the problem statement and implement the solution by writing the code in the specified area.
