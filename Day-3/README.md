# Control Flow and Logical Operators

1. Conditional statement
    - if else statement

    ```
    if condition:
        do this
    else:
        do this
    ```

    Lets use our bathtub water level for example

    ```
    water_level = 50 
    if water_level > 80:
        print("Drain water!")
    else:
        print("Continue filling")
    ```

2. Comparison Operators
    | Operator      | Meaning                  |
    | :---          |    :----:                |
    | >             | Greater than             |
    | <             | Less than                |
    | >=            | Greater than or equal to |
    | <=            | Less than or equal to    |
    | ==            | Equal to                 |
    | !=            | Not equal to             |

    - *Note*: The equal sign might be a bit tricky or confusing for beginners. The single equal sign "=" is used to asign a value to a varaible, while the double equal sign "==" is used to  check a condiiton.
