# Python Functions & Karel

1. Functions 
    Python has alot of buit in function we use regularly eg the print() function, the len() function. Read on more python functions [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html).
    
    - If you want to build in your own function you start out with a key word which is called 'def' , then add the name of your function.

    ``` 
    def my_function():
        Do this
        Then do this
        Finally do this
    ```

    Note: The parentheses is what differentiate a function from a variable

2. While loop

    ```
    while something_is_true:
        Do this
        Then do this
        Finally do this
    ```

    - For loops are used when you want to iterate over something and you need to do something with each thing that you are iterating over.

    - While loops will keep running till the condition returns a false. If you have a condition has never been false,then you have something we call an infinite loop

Test out your understanding of while loop [here](https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html?lang=en&mode=python&menu=worlds%2Fmenus%2Freeborg_intro_en.json&name=Home%201&url=worlds%2Ftutorial_en%2Fhome1.json)
