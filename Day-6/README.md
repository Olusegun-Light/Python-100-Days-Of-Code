# Python Functions & Karel

This repository contains examples of Python functions and an introduction to the concept of while loops.

## Functions

Python has a lot of built-in functions that are commonly used, such as the `print()` function and the `len()` function. You can learn more about Python functions in the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html).

If you want to create your own function, you start with the keyword `def` followed by the name of your function. Here's an example:

```python
def my_function():
    # Do something
    print("Hello")
    print("Bye")
```

Note that the parentheses after the function name differentiate it from a variable.

## While Loop

While loops are used when you want to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a certain condition is true. Here's the basic syntax:

```python
while condition:
    # Do something
    print("Looping...")
```

While loops continue running until the condition evaluates to false. Be careful to avoid infinite loops where the condition never becomes false.

You can test your understanding of while loops using the [Karel programming environment](https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html?lang=en&mode=python&menu=worlds%2Fmenus%2Freeborg_intro_en.json&name=Home%201&url=worlds%2Ftutorial_en%2Fhome1.json).
