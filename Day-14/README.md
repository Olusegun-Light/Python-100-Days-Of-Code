## How to Play

1. The game will present you with two Instagram accounts, labeled as A and B.
2. Your task is to guess which account has more followers.
3. Type 'A' if you think account A has more followers, or type 'B' if you think account B has more followers.
4. Each correct guess earns you a point, and your score will be displayed after each round.
