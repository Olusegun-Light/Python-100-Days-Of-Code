# Function Parameters & Caesar Cipher

1. Functions with Inputs

You can add a name of a variable inside the parentheses to start giving our functions some inputs:

```python
def my_function(something):
    # Do this
    # Then do this
    # Finally do this

my_function(argument)
```

- `something` is referred to as a parameter, while `argument` is referred to as the argument.
- The argument is what is going to be passed to the function when it is called.
- The parameter is the name of the data; the parameter is used inside the function to refer to it and to perform operations on it.

## Caesar Cipher

The Caesar Cipher is a simple encryption technique that involves shifting each letter in the plaintext by a certain number of positions down or up the alphabet. The number of positions to shift is determined by the key or shift amount provided.

## How to Use the Caesar Cipher

1. Run the Python script to start the program.
2. You will be prompted to choose between encoding or decoding.
3. Enter your message and the shift number.
4. The program will display the encoded or decoded result.
5. You can choose to go again or exit the program.
