# Function Parameters & Caesar Cipher

1. Functions with Inputs 
    You can add a name of a variable inside the parentheses to start giving our functions some inputs
  
        ```
        def my_function(something):
            #Do this 
            #Then do this
            #Finally do this
        
        my_function()
        ````

        - something = 123
            something is referred to as parameter, while
            123 is referred to as the argument 
            -The argument is what going to be passed to the function when it been called.
            -The parameter is the name of the data,  the parameter is used inside the function to refer to it and to do things with it.
